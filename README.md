## ⚙️ Environment Setup

- Python version: `>=3.8`

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
🧠 Model Overview
•	Task: Binary classification — predict presence or absence of postoperative complications
•	Algorithms supported: RandomForest, XGBoost, etc.
•	Input: Structured clinical and intraoperative variables
•	Output: Trained model and predicted probabilities
🚀 Usage Instructions
1. Model Training (train/)
Prepare your CSV training data. The format should include:
•	Clinical features (e.g., age, sex, BMI, operative time, material)
•	Target label: complication (0 = no, 1 = yes)
Run:
bash
复制编辑
python train/train_model.py --input your_train_data.csv --output model.pkl
The script performs:
•	Data preprocessing
•	Model training (with cross-validation)
•	Model saving (model.pkl)
Model settings can be modified in train/config.yaml.
________________________________________
2. Model Evaluation (eval/)
To apply the trained model to a separate external dataset, run:
bash
复制编辑
python eval/evaluate_model.py --input your_external_data.csv --model model.pkl
Outputs:
•	Predicted probabilities
•	Performance metrics (AUC, Accuracy, Brier score)
•	Optional plots (ROC curve, calibration curve, etc.) saved to eval/output/
Expected external input format is described in eval/external_data_note.md.
________________________________________
🔒 Data Handling
•	This repository does not include any clinical or patient-level data.
•	All code is structured to ensure clear separation between training and external validation.
•	No test data are used in model training or hyperparameter tuning.
